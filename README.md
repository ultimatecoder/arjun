[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ultimatecoder/arjun.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ultimatecoder/arjun)


## Overview

**Arjun** üèπ is a [ReST][1] API for managing team members :necktie:. It is a
lightweight, easy to use tool.


## Architecture :european_castle:

* Database: [MySQL][2]
* Programming language: [Python3][3] :snake:
* Framework: [Django][6]
* Container: [Docker][7]


## Development :wrench:

* **Build:** Dependency management and isolation is done using [Pipenv][5]
  tool.

  ```make build```

  Make sure Python 3.x is your global version. You have to run a build
  command once or whenever project is changing its dependencies. It is safe to
  re-run this command.

* **Run:**

  ```make run```

  Calling this command will run pending migrations.  Make your your MySQL[2]
  service is running on port `3306`. It will launch a Django demo server on port
  `8000`. Make sure the port `8000` is available for server.

  You can also run this project using [Docker][7]. Running this project with
  docker do not require any prioer step. MySQL service will be launched using a
  docker container.

  ``` make docker ```

  You can access the API at host port `8000`. Make sure [Docker][7] is installed
  in your workstation.  Make sure existing service of MySQL isn't running on
  port `3306`.


## Test :hammer:

* **Linting**:

  ```make lint```

  This command will lint code using [flake8][9]. You should have performed build
  step prioer to running this command.

* **Test**:

  ```make test```

  This command will launch Django testing server to perform all level of tests.
  You should have performed build step prioer to runnign this command. Make sure
  you are running a MySQL[2] service on port `3306`.
